        <div class="instruction">
            <h1><sup class="child">Children</sup>Order, flex-grow and flex-basis</h1>
            <h3>Order</h3>
            <p>By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container. To define an item's order, use <code>order: 5; /* default is 0 */</code> on the <strong>child element</strong>. You can use negative numbers with order</p>
            
            <h3>Flex-grow</h3>
            <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up. Use: <code>flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */</code>.</p>

            <p>If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).</p>

            <p>Negative numbers are invalid for the value or flex-grow.</p>

            <h3>Flex-basis</h3>
            <p>This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means "look at my width or height property." Use the code: <code>flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */</code>.</p>
            <p>If set to 0, the extra space around content isnâ€™t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its flex-grow value. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/rel-vs-abs-flex.svg">this graphic</a>.</p>

            <p>So when is this useful? When you're making layouts for different screensizes, you might want to reorder items within a container like in the example below.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Use media queries and a combination of these CSS properties to match the picture.</p>
        <nav class="container">
            <div>1</div>
            <div>2</div>
            <div>3</div>
        </nav>
